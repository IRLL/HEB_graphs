Git Commit Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. ``:tada: Add cool new feature`` instead of ``:tada: Added cool new feature``).
You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!

Version Numbers
---------------

Version numbers will be assigned according to the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_. scheme.
This means, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we will increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.
